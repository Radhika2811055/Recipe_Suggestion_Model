# Recipe_Suggestion_Model
Built a machine learning model that recommends recipes based on user-input ingredients. Utilized scikit-learn for model training and Spoonacular API/Kaggle dataset for recipe data. Developed the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and integrated it with the ML model. Implemented calorie-based filtering to suggest health-conscious recipes.
